# PGSNN-GMM
This reposititory provides supplementary codes and data for the following work:

- Liu, X., Chen, S., Fu, L., Li, X., & Cotton, F. (2025). Physics-guided symbolic neural network reveals optimal functional forms describing ground motions. Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, 188, 109100. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soildyn.2024.109100

You can directly run the 'pgsnn_prediction.py' to get the results of different parameters-scaling.

Or you can also write your own code using the coefficient files('../Result/coef_smoothed_pgsnn.xlsx') and the form of the equations in the paper.

The code used for the models in this paper was modified by us from https://github.com/martius-lab/EQL-Pytorch.git.
You can find details about this method in this paper below:
